This project attempts to visualize the relationships between users in a GroupMe
group. A group is represented as a graph of nodes (users) and directed and
weighted edges between nodes (likes). The size of a node is the number of
messages that user has sent. An edge from A to B represents A liking messages
from B, and the weight of the edge represents the number of likes.
